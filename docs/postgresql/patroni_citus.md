# Patroni + Citus

This PostgreSQL container image supports integration of Patroni with Citus out of the box. This combination allows you to build a distributed PostgreSQL cluster with high availability and horizontal scaling capabilities. Patroni manages the failover and replication aspects, while Citus distributes data and queries across multiple nodes, making it suitable for large-scale applications requiring both resilience and performance.
