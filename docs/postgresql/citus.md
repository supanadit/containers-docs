# Citus

This PostgreSQL container image includes Citus, an extension that transforms PostgreSQL into a distributed database capable of handling large-scale data and high-throughput workloads. Citus enables horizontal scaling by distributing data and queries across multiple nodes, making it ideal for applications that require real-time analytics and high availability.
